<h1><a href=/>Scientific computing</a></h1><h2>(for the rest of us)</h2></header><main>
<h1>Welcome!</h1><p><strong>One specific challenge, when writing code as a scientist, is that we care <em>a
lot</em> about getting the <em>right</em> answer; but of course, the <em>right</em> answer is
not always obvious. So we should be very careful with the code we write. A
piece of code that crashes is annoying; but a piece of code that runs, and
give you the wrong answer can compromise your science and your career. This
guide will help you adopt practices that make it less likely to introduce
mistakes in your code, and more likely to catch them. Hopefully, this will let
all of us write code we can trust more.</strong></p><p>Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points. You can use these lessons on your own, or as a group.</p><div class=main-links>

</div><p>This material has been designed according to three core ideas:</p><p>First, <strong>each module is short</strong>, and introduces a <em>single</em> concept. In many
places, you will notice advice redirecting you to the documentation. The
<a href=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/><em>Julia</em> manual</a> is extremely thorough, and
the point of this material is to show &ldquo;how things work&rdquo; (as opposed to going
into all of the different ways they can be made to work).</p><p>Second, <strong>this material is <em>not</em> about showcasing different packages</strong>. There
are some situations where we will need to go into the details of <em>e.g.</em>
<span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/Makie target=_blank>Makie</a></span></span> for plotting, but it is expected that you will, again, read the
documentation for the packages that are loaded. Every time a package is
mentioned, you can click on its name to be redirected to the <a href=https://juliapackages.com/>Julia Packages
page</a>; packages with no documentation on the hub (like <em>e.g.</em> <span class="package no-hub"><span class=pkgname>Base</span></span>)
have a different styling. The material relies most of the time only on
packages from <em>Julia</em>&rsquo;s standard library.</p><p>Finally, <strong>no error messages</strong>. This is an important design concept. Although
error messages happen in the daily practice of programming, the point of this
material is to anticipate and handle exceptions gracefully.</p><section class=modules>
<h3 class=newsection>Getting Started</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>These modules offer a very high-level overview of how to setup a project,
organize your work, and install <em>Julia</em>. They do not require any familiarity
with programming, and are mostly concerned about making sure that you can plan a
computing project ahead of time. Note that installation instructions are not
covered until late into the module (by design!).</p></div><div class=cards>

<div class="title status-release">
<span class=index>00/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/introduction/preparing-a-project/>Preparing a project</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, before we write any code, we will start thinking about what a
project is, how we can set one up on our computer, and why this might help
defeat coder&rsquo;s block.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>00/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/introduction/flowcharts/>Flowcharts</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>One of the most powerful tool to plan a programming task is to draw a
flowchart. In simple terms, a flowchart will let you map the different steps
that the program will have to follow, and see what is required for each of
them. To illustrate, we will use a flowchart not of a program, but of a
pancake recipe.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>00/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/introduction/pseudo-code/>Pseudo-code</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>To facilitate the transition between diagram and code, one important step is
to write <em>pseudo-code</em>, <em>i.e.</em> text that looks reasonably like code, but is
not. This pseudo-code will not help the computer think about our problem,
but it might help <em>us</em> think about the problem in ways that will make the
actual programming easier.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>00/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/introduction/installing-julia/>Installing Julia</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how we can install <em>Julia</em>, setup a default
version, and go through some of the usual tools involved in setting up a good
<em>Julia</em> development environment. We will not deal with the installation of
<em>packages</em> quite yet, as this will be done with its own module.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>00/04</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/introduction/environment-and-projects/>Environment and projects</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this previous module, we did not load a single package: everything we
wanted to do was provided by <em>Julia</em> &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. In most applications,
we will need to get functionalities from other packages, and this is where
<em>Julia</em>&rsquo;s package manager shines.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Fundamentals</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>The goal of these modules is to increase your familiarity with some of the most
fundamental notions: how to think like a computer, in values that are either
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, and what types are (and why they matter!).</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>01/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/fundamentals/introduction-to-boolean-values/>Introduction to Boolean values</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will get acquainted with one of the most important type of
variables: Boolean values. They represent values that are either <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>, which is a key element in a number of problems.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>01/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/fundamentals/short-circuit-boolean-operations/>Short-circuit Boolean operations</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In the <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/fundamentals/introduction-to-boolean-values/>previous module</a>, we have introduce important notions about
Boolean values. In this module, we will expand upon this knowledge in ways
that will enable us to be more expressive with the code we write.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>01/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/fundamentals/the-ternary-operator/>The ternary operator</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will look at the &ldquo;ternary operator&rdquo;, a very efficient
shortcut to perform a logical test in a single line. This is a construct we
will use quite a lot to express both possible outcomes of a conditional expression using
a single line!</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>01/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/fundamentals/types/>Types</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will look at one of the most important concept in <em>Julia</em>:
types. Types are, to be really imprecise, the way a programming language
thinks about a value. A lot of problems arise from the fact that programming
languages are very opinionated.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Data Structures</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>In these modules, we will take a little tour of some of the most important ways
to represent data; in particular, we will see how they can be used, when they
should be used, and how they interact.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/an-introduction-to-arrays/>An introduction to arrays</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of scientific computing eventually boils down to accessing things in
structures that look like vectors or matrices. In this module, we will examine
the basic syntax to create, interact with, and transpose these structures. This is
one of the most foundational module in the class, as we will be using an
absurd quantity of vectors and matrices moving forward.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/indexing-slicing-and-all-that/>Indexing, slicing, and all that</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In the previous module, we have introduced the notion of <code>Array</code>s, and
experimented with the shape of vectors and matrices. In this module, we will
continue our exploration of these objects, and see how we can modify and
access the information they store.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/dictionaries-and-pairs/>Dictionaries and pairs</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will explore two very useful data structures: dictionaries,
which serve as &ldquo;key-value&rdquo; stores, and pairs, which serve as (essentially) the
same thing but smaller.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/tuples-named-tuples-and-sets/>Tuples, named tuples, and sets</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will explore data structures that look a lot like arrays,
but have subtly different use cases: tuples, named tuples, and sets. Knowing
when to use arrays and when to use others data structure can really make a
difference in your programming!s</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/04</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/strings-symbols-and-text/>Strings, symbols, and text</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will look at string and characters, <em>i.e.</em> representations
of text. These objects are really interesting in <em>Julia</em> because not only do
they store information, they can store a little bit of computation as well.
The point of this module is to go through the basics of what strings are, and
we will revisit advanced operations in later sections.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>02/05</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/data-structures/building-your-own-types/>Building your own types</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will <em>briefly</em> see how we can define our own types (<em>aka</em>
<code>struct</code>), and give them a hierarchy. We will barely scratch the surface of
what can be done with custom types, as the real fun will take place in the
modules on <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/understanding-dispatch/>dispatch</a> and <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-topics/overloading/>overloading</a> (don&rsquo;t read
them yet!).</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>The Flow</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>The point of this module is to understand how we can direct the flow of
execution. This covers iteration, loops, advanced loops, and the ways in which
we can handle (and react to) errors arising during execution. These modules will
give you to most important building block towards building complex programs.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/a-gentle-introduction-to-for-loops/>A gentle introduction to for loops</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>Oh no. Oh no no no. This is <em>not</em> a fun module. This will not be pleasant. But
this will, very much, be necessary and incredibly empowering. Sit down, buckle
up, we&rsquo;re about to see what loops do.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/advanced-iteration/>Advanced iteration</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how we <em>actually</em> iterate over objects in <em>Julia</em>.
Although the content of the previous module is very important, as it forms the
basis of all ways to iterate, there are a number of functions that greatly
facilitate our task. We finish this module by simulating a simple
host-parasitoid model.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/iteration-in-action/>Iteration in action!</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will start integrating skills from the previous modules,
both about iteration and about data structures, indexing, slicing, etc. We
will simulate the temporal dynamics of two populations, one of hosts and one
of parasitoids, using a simple time-discrete model.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/the-while-statement/>The while statement</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how we can use the <code>while</code> construct to make a
series of instructions repeat until a condition is met, and how to deal with
common caveats that can arise when using a <code>while</code> loop.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/04</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/exiting-loops/>Exiting loops</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In the previous two modules, we have written loops that terminate when a
condition is met (<code>while</code>), or when the collection has been iterated over
entirely (<code>for</code>). In some cases, we may want to fine-tune the behavior of our
iteration. In these cases, we can use some special keywords to jump out of the
loop entirely, or skip some steps.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>03/05</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/flow/error-handling-with-try/>Error handling with try</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In previous modules, we have used a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> statement. In this module,
we will go into some detail about what it means, and how to use them to write
code that handles errors gracefully.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Basic Functions Usage</h3><div class=blurb>
<p><em>Julia</em> is a language that <em>loves</em> dealing with functions. In this section, we
will have a look at the various ways to declare them, but also take a deep dive
in the dispatch system, and finally examine how we can create our own functions
as we go.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>04/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/declaring-functions/>Declaring functions</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>Everything should be a function. Everything. Especially in <em>Julia</em>, for
performance related reasons that are far beyond the scope of this material. So
one of the first, most significant piece of knowledge to acquire is: how do I
declare a function?</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-release">
<span class=index>04/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/understanding-dispatch/>Understanding dispatch</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>The point of this module is to understand <em>dispatch</em>, which is to say, the way
the correct method is called based on the arguments; we will also see how to
use it to write the least possible amount of code!</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>04/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/multiple-dispatch-in-practice/>Multiple dispatch in practice</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will expand on the previous content (understanding
<em>dispatch</em>) to get familiar with a central design paradigm of <em>Julia</em>:
multiple dispatch. We will do so by writing code to simulate the growth of a
population in space.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>04/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/returning-functions/>Returning functions</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will learn how we can write functions that return other
functions. Because this seems a little weird at first, we will also discuss
situations in which this is a useful design pattern, and see how this approach
can be used together with Julia&rsquo;s powerful dispatch system.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>04/04</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/broadcasting-and-the-dot-notation/>Broadcasting and the dot notation</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In some of the previous modules, we have used a notation that looked like
<code>function.(arguments)</code>, or <code>x .+ y</code>. In this module, we will talk about what
the <code>.</code> notation does, and more broadly, what <em>broadcasting</em> is.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>04/05</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/keyword-arguments-and-splatting/>Keyword arguments and splatting</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In the previous modules, we have defined functions that used <em>positional</em>
arguments, some with default values, some without. In this module, we will
look at keyword arguments and splatting, to build functions that we can
control a bit more.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>04/06</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/functions/documenting-functions/>Documenting functions</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will look at what is probably the most important part of writing
a function: writing its documentation. By the end of this module, you will be able to
write a docstring for your function that is accessible through <em>Julia</em>&rsquo;s help mode.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Advanced Functions Usage</h3><div class=blurb>
<p><em>Julia</em> is a language that <em>loves</em> dealing with functions. In this section, we
will have a look at the various ways to declare them, but also take a deep dive
in the dispatch system, and finally examine how we can create our own functions
as we go.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>05/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-functions/mutating-functions/>Mutating functions</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how <em>Julia</em> deals with collections when they are
passed as arguments to a function, why this can be terrifying when coming from
other languages that are less concerned with economy of memory, and how we can
use this behavior to write more efficient code.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>05/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-functions/dispatch-on-element-types/>Dispatch on element types</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this lesson, we will see how we can dispatch on parametric types, in order
to have a fine-grained control on what method is used for different
types of data collections. This is a core design pattern in <em>Julia</em>, and we will
illustrate it by building some functions related to measuring the distances between
points.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-alpha">
<span class=index>05/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-functions/testing-functions/>Testing functions</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will explore the <code>Test</code> package, which allows to
programmatically test the behavior of a function. We will see how testing can
bring us closer to being confident in our code.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>05/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-functions/recursion/>Recursion</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>What is recursion, if not recursion persevering? In this module, we will see
how to call functions recursively, and discuss when this is appropriate in
real life.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-alpha">
<span class=index>05/04</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-functions/type-stability/>Type stability</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will talk about <em>type stability</em>, and see how we can
annotate the functions in <em>Julia</em> to be explicit about what type they return.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Advanced Topics</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>This section contains modules that cover more advanced topics, that will let you
write code that is more and more expressive, more and more safe to run, and more
and more efficient. Picking up these skills will be important to follow along
with the applied examples in the next section.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>06/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-topics/map-filter-accumulate-reduce/>Map, Filter, Accumulate, Reduce</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In a lot of applications, we want to apply some operation to all elements in a
collection, and then aggregate these elements together in a grand unified
answer. In this module, we will have a look at the map-filter-reduce strategy,
as well as the accumulate operation.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>06/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-topics/finding-things-in-arrays/>Finding things in arrays</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how to locate interesting values in collections,
and how to extract and test the existence of some of these values. This is
important knowledge in order to build more advanced programs, and we will put
it in action in the following section.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>06/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/advanced-topics/overloading/>Overloading</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>Overloading is a <em>very</em> powerful mechanism, through which we can add methods
to existing functions to make them work with our own types. In this module, we
will discuss how to overload existing functions, and how to use this approach
in practice.</p></div></div><div class=card>

<p>The goal of these modules is to develop proficiency in working with files. We
will see how to handle the path, create and delete directories, download files,
and open common data formats like delimited files, CSV, and JSON.</p></div><div class=cards>
<div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>07/00</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/files/the-path/>The Path</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>One of the main obstacle to reproductible projects is issues with describing
where files are. In this module, we will talk about the path, and how to refer
to locations in a way that will work on any computer.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-rc">
<span class=index>07/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/files/downloading-files/>Downloading files</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will see how <em>Julia</em> allows downloading files from the
internet, and how we can decide where to store them. This is a common task
when getting external data, and will be the basis of a number of advanced
training modules in the final section of this material.</p></div></div><div class=card>
<div class="title status-beta">
<span class=index>07/02</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/files/working-with-delimited-files/>Working with delimited files</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>A lot of files we use in scientific computing are very simple, and organized
as tables. There are a lot of packages in <em>Julia</em> to handle these files,
including the full-featured <span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/DataFrames target=_blank>DataFrames</a></span></span> and <span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/DataFramesMeta target=_blank>DataFramesMeta</a></span></span>. But in this
module, we will focus on the standard library package <span class="package no-hub"><span class=pkgname>DelimitedFiles</span></span>,
which allows to store files where fields are separated by a specified
character.</p></div></div><div class=card>

<span class=index>07/03</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/files/the-json-format/>The JSON format</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>The JSON format is really interesting to store highly structured information.
In this module, we will see how it maps naturally on the <code>Dict</code> data
structure, how to use it to load and save data, and how to print the contents
of a JSON file. As an illustration, we will look at the time series of
vaccination against COVID-19 in New Zealand.</p></div></div><div class=card>

</div><div class=summary>
<p>Not all data come from static files. In a large number of scientific
applications, we need to collect data from websites, often using a <a href=https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api>RESTful
API</a>. In this module, we will use a very simple example to show how we
can collect data about postal codes, get them as a JSON file, and process
them.</p></div></div></div><h3 class=newsection>Applications</h3><div class=blurb>
<p>In this section, we will go through longer modules involving real data, in order
to apply the various skills we picked up from the previous sections. These are
the modules you should read last, as even though they do not introduce new
material, they will require to have some command over the concepts from multiple
previous modules.</p></div><div class=cards>

</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will use the gradient descent algorithm to perform a linear
regression, to estimate the brain mass of an animal if we know its body mass.
This will draw on concepts from a number of previous modules, while also
presenting an example of how core programming skills can be applied for
research.</p></div></div><div class=card>

<span class=index>08/01</span> <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/applications/naive-bayes-classifier/>Naive Bayes Classifier</a>
</div><div class=summary>
<p>Naive Bayes Classifiers are formidable because they can learn so much about a
dataset based on relatively scarce information. In this module, we will build
one from scratch, using (mostly) methods from <em>Julia</em>&rsquo;s standard library.</p></div></div><div class=card>

</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will have a look at indexing in order to simulate the
behavior of a forest when trees can catch on fire, be planted, and regrow.
This is a common example in complex system studies, and produces very visually
pleasing structures in space! As a treat, we will spend a little more time
learning about how <span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/Makie target=_blank>Makie</a></span></span> works.</p></div></div><div class=card>

</div><div class=summary>
<p>In this module, we will look at a way to start working on the travelling salesperson
problem. This is mostly an excuse to play with simulated annealing, which is a really cool
optimisation algorithm.</p></div></div></div></section></main><footer>
