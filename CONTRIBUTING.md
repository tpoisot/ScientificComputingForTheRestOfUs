# Hi!

Thanks for contributing to this project. Any addition and comment is useful, and
we're grateful that you are investing some time.

## Contributing

There are a number of ways to contribute. Before you start, please have a look
at our [Code of Conduct][coc]. It boils down to *be nice and respectful* -- no
contribution, no matter how amazing it may be, justifies or excuses bad
behaviour.

[coc]: https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

The first thing you can do is comment on Issues that have the ["Request for
feedback"][feedback] label. They represent situations for which we are actively
seeking community feedback, and anyone is always welcome to chime in.

If you are not sure about opening an issue, you can use the [chatroom][discord].
We'll be glad to have a more informal conversation with you!

If there is a more specific point you would like to raise, you can [create a new
Issue][new_issue], and explain your idea, critique, or comment. And of course,
you can always browse the [current Issues][issues], to get a sense of what is
being discussed.

If you want to contribute more, then great! Have a look at the [contribution
guidelines][cguid] first, to get you started with setting up a development
environment. You can have a look at ["Good first issues"][first], if you want
some inspiration.

## How to setup your development environment?

All of the content is built using *Literate.jl*. The lessons themselves are
*Julia* scripts, and they are compiled to markdown using github actions. It is a
good idea to look at existing modules to get a sense of how to do callouts, etc.

The references are in the `references.bib` file at the root of the project.

Finally, *all lessons* undergo formatting (using the "Format Document") command
in VSCode.
