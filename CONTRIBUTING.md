# Hi!

Thanks for contributing to this project. Any addition and comment is useful, and
we're grateful that you are investing some time.

## Contributing

There are a number of ways to contribute. Before you start, please have a look
at our [Code of Conduct][coc]. It boils down to *be nice and respectful* -- no
contribution, no matter how amazing it may be, justifies or excuses bad
behaviour.

[coc]: https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

The first thing you can do is comment on Issues that have the ["Request for
feedback"][feedback] label. They represent situations for which we are actively
seeking community feedback, and anyone is always welcome to chime in.

[feedback]: https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/labels/request%20for%20feedback

If you are not sure about opening an issue, you can use the
[chatroom][gitterlink]. We'll be glad to have a more informal conversation with
you!

[gitterlink]: https://gitter.im/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/Lobby

If there is a more specific point you would like to raise, you can [create a new
Issue][new_issue], and explain your idea, critique, or comment. And of course,
you can always browse the [current Issues][issues], to get a sense of what is
being discussed.

If you want to contribute more, then great! Have a look at the [contribution
guidelines][cguid] first, to get you started with setting up a development
environment. You can have a look at ["Good first issues"][first], if you want
some inspiration.
