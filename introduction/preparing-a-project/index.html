<h1>Preparing a project</h1><article>
<p>In this module, before we write any code, we will start thinking about what a
project is, how we can set one up on our computer, and why this might help
defeat coder&rsquo;s block.</p><p>If your working environment looks anything like mine, the first thing you may
see on a new project will look like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[tpoisot@fedora ~]$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type &#34;?&#34; for help, &#34;]?&#34; for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.8.0 (2022-08-17)

|__/                   |

julia&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is highly intimidating. The cursor blinks expectantly, and you might not
have a single clue what to type. Good. Because before we do anything, we need
to think about project organisation.</p><p>Facing an empty text editor or a blinking REPL (it stands for Read/Execute/Print
Loop, and this the place where you type things) prompt at the beginning of a
programming task is like facing an empty page at the beginning of a writing
project. To make it easier to work through, one really good (but also really
uncommon) approach is to walk away from the computer. Instead of trying to write
code, we will first try to articulate the structure of our project - and not
jumping to our keyboard works really well for this.</p><p>Here is a productivity tip: work in such a way that you do not need to think
about the non-important parts of your project. For us, this means having a
standard layout for any project, and using it consistently. We will suggest one
such layout below, but this is not the only one. There are an infinity of them,
and the one that <em>works</em> is the one that works <em>for you</em>.</p><p>Still, there are some good guidelines to follow.</p><p>First, a project is a folder, everything in the project belongs to the folder,
and everything outside the folder cannot belong to the project. This is
important because it maximizes the chances that you can copy your project to
another computer, and have it &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. Of course in real life, things
seldom &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, and this is why we should pay extra care to the practices
that maximise the chances of it being the case.</p><div class="callout information">This is not necessarily true if your project involves remote
computing, or very large amounts of data. But then again, if you work in such
a way, we expect that you will have read the documentation, and sought proper
training.</div><p>Second, file paths are not your friends. By far the biggest obstacle to
reproducibility is the difference in ways to tell the computer <em>where files
are</em>. We encourage to use <em>relative paths</em>, relative specifically to the
folder in which your project lives. We will talk more about dealing with
directories and paths and files in the <a href=https://sciencecomputing.io/files/the-path/>path</a> module.</p><p>Third, and final principle, similar things should be grouped together. In other
words, it will be easier to navigate our project if there is a folder called
<code>data</code> and it contains data, a folder called <code>figures</code> and it contains figures,
and a folder called <code>code</code> which contains code. The name and variety of these
folders is left up to you.</p><p>With this in mind, here is a possible template for a project.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>.
├── .git                    # We use version control, always!
│   └── ...
├── artifacts               # Outputs that are not figures go here
│   └── summary.csv
├── code                    # Code that creates something goes here
│   ├── figure01.jl
│   └── simulations.jl
├── data                    # Raw data goes here
│   └── BCI.data
├── lib                     # Useful functions go here
│   ├── environmentaldata.jl
│   └── model.jl
├── LICENSE                 # We use a license, always!
├── README.md               # Also mandatory: a README
├── Project.toml
├── Manifest.toml
└── text                    # This folder can store notes and documents
    └── notes.md
</code></pre><p>There are a few files here on which it is worth spending a little more time.
Their names are presented below as links, to the resource that we think is the
most informative. It is, indeed, a very good idea to read the content of these
links as well.</p><p>The <a href=https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/>README</a> is a standard file for all projects, which gives
information about the project, how to run it, the dependencies, who is in
charge, <em>etc</em>. Writing a good README is a difficult task, but this is going to
be the point of entry in your project. Show it some love.</p><p><a href=https://choosealicense.com/>LICENSE</a> is the text of a license, which gives information about
intellectual property and your own liability regarding the use of your
project. Picking FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) licenses is recommended,
and there are a lot of the to accomodate different use cases. The <a href=https://choosealicense.com/>choose a
license</a> website is a very good place to get started.</p><p>Finally, and these are language-specific, the <a href=https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/><em>Julia</em> package manager</a>
will create files to track the dependencies of your project; <code>Project.toml</code>
(which can be distributed alongside your project), and <code>Manifest.toml</code>, which
is a machine-specific file with a <em>lot</em> of information. Check out the
documentation.</p><div class="callout information">We will spend more time with the <em>Julia</em> package manager soon. It is a
slightly unusual piece of software when coming from <em>e.g.</em> <em>R</em> or <em>Python</em>,
but it is very powerful and makes reproducibility much, much easier.</div></article></main><footer>
