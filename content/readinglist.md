title: Suggested readings

In a rush? Yes you are. We suggest ["Good enough practices in scientific
computing"][goodenough] to get you started.

A little bit more time? We think ["Best practices in scientific
computing"][best] might suit you.

Want a more complete thing to read? ["The pragmatic programmer"][pragm] is a
masterpiece. I have also heard great things about ["Clean code"][cleanc]. The
online book ["How to think like a computer scientist"][httlacs] is based on
Julia, and very thorough. Finally, ["Hands-on design patterns and best practices
with Julia"][handson] is a wonderfully accessible book that will make you a
better programmer, even if *Julia* is not your main language.

If you still have some time, you can read something about [ways to improve user
confidence in your software][userconf], or ways to [elevate code as a research
output][elevate].

[Code is Science][codeissci] is a very nice project about making peer review of
scientific code more common. They have a list of [issues you can
tackle][cisissues] to help!

Finally, a short [Q&A at *Nature Jobs*][qanda] about this project.
