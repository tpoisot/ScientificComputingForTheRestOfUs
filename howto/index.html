<h1>How to use this material</h1><article>
<p>The best way to read this material is to keep a terminal running <em>Julia</em> open,
and <strong>type</strong> the code. It is tempting to copy and paste, but typing the code
actually matters. The sections (and modules within them) are presented in
chronological order, and whenever possible (most of the time) introduce one
concept at a time. Every so often, an illustration or example will start to
re-use previous knowledge, and this gets more common in the later sections.
The content is definitely designed to be read from beginning to end!</p><p>The lessons have a release cycle, and the current position of the modules in
this cycle is indicated next to their title in the main page (and their node on the
timeline for each module is also color-coded). The cycle has four steps. &ldquo;Building&rdquo; means
that the lesson is not ready to be used at all. We are working on it. &ldquo;Writing&rdquo; means that
there is some information, but it can change at any time, or be updated and overhauled, or
that the content is ready but has not been used for actual training yet.
&ldquo;Testing&rdquo; means that the lesson is ready to be used, and will receive updates based on the
experience of actually teaching it. Finally, &ldquo;Released&rdquo; is the most mature step in the
cycle, and means that after sufficiently many uses of the lesson, it is not expected to
change in significant ways. Lessons labelled as released or in testing are meant to be
usable in a self-directed learning way, although the later will need some clarifications.
Almost all &ldquo;in testing&rdquo; lessons have been used for actual training, but will only move up
to the &ldquo;released&rdquo; stage when we are ready to stop tinkering with them.</p><p>A very good
way to contribute is to look at modules awaiting testing and give feedback
(using <a href=https://discord.gg/Ak2pK3yG9M>Discord</a> or <a href=https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/issues>GitHub issues</a>), or to check out modules
in development and jumping into adding content!</p><p>Whenever a package is discussed, it will be presented in a little box, like
<em>e.g.</em> <span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/Distributions target=_blank>Distributions</a></span></span>. Clicking on this link will open a new window with
the Julia packages documentation hub, which will hopefully provide you with an
incentive to checkout what the packages do!</p><p>You will notice that there are very few comments in the material. This is
because the text surrounding the code <em>are</em> the comments. The modules are
actual <em>Julia</em> scripts, executed using the <span class=package><span class=pkgname><a href=https://juliapackages.com/p/Literate target=_blank>Literate</a></span></span> package. This ensure
that whatever you see on screen is the result of an actual code execution.
Furthermore, there is no hidden code!</p><p>Snippets of code that are <em>important</em> are presented this way (and their
output, when not silenced, is immediately below them):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-julia data-lang=julia><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=p>[</span><span class=n>rand</span><span class=p>()</span> <span class=k>for</span> <span class=n>i</span> <span class=k>in</span> <span class=mi>1</span><span class=o>:</span><span class=mi>5</span><span class=p>]</span>

type), are presented this way:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-raw data-lang=raw>for each_element in vector
  function(each_element)
end
</code></pre><p>Throughout the lessons, we have added some asides &ndash; they are ranked in order
of importance. The first are &ldquo;informations&rdquo;:</p><div class="callout information">All that should matter in the choice of tools, language, environment,
is that it lets you become productive, and solve the problem you want to
solve.</div><p>&ldquo;Opinions&rdquo; are points we would like to raise for the reader&rsquo;s consideration,
and can be ignored. Example:</p><div class="callout opinion">People who think it&rsquo;s OK to criticize others based on their choice
of language, OS, text editor, etc, should go home and think about what they
did.</div><p>&ldquo;Warnings&rdquo; are points that can be important, but not necessarily as a novice.
It is worth keeping a mental note of them, especially in the long term.
Example:</p><div class="callout warning">Any time you are about to comment on people&rsquo;s choice of tools, ask
yourself whether this is really necessary, and the answer is usually &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The
Good Tool is the one that works for its user.</div><p>&ldquo;Dangers&rdquo; are really important points, that can prove especially dangerous or
risky to everyone. They are worth reading a few times over. Example:</p><div class="callout danger">This toxic behaviour is driving brilliant people away, and should
never be tolerated. Disliking Windows has not made anyone edgy or cool since
1998.</div><p>More rarely, there will be a few &ldquo;Big Brain Time&rdquo; callouts, meant to
contextualize the code with do with some mentions of domain knowledge.</p><div class="callout domain">It&rsquo;s big brain time!</div><p>If you want to contribute, there are a number of ways to do so! Before you
start, please have a look at our <a href=https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>Code of Conduct</a>. It boils down to <em>be
nice and respectful</em> &ndash; no contribution, no matter how amazing it may be,
justifies or excuses bad behaviour. For the actual details on how to
contribute, head over to the <a href=https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>guidelines</a>.</p></article></main><footer>
