title: About this material
---

This material is aimed at people who have already interacted with a computer
using a programming language, but want to adopt best practices that make their
code more robust. It can also be used to facilitate the onboarding of new people
in your lab or your project.

Scientific computing can be very diverse, ranging from a few-step analysis
of small data sets to simulations running for weeks on supercomputers.
We focus on the most common situations that every scientist encounters
at some stage of a research project: data analyses performed on a standard
desktop computer. The general ideas and principles that we expose carry over
to other situations as well, but the concrete tools and methods may not
be suitable for tasks requiring special hardware such as GPUs or supercomputers,
or for projects requiring a significant software development effort.

We will use the [Julia][jl] programming language; but you don't need to know
anything about it either. We will keep the discussion very general. In fact, you
will see that good practices for scientific computing have very little to do
with tools and technical things; instead, they rely on thinking about
programming in a slightly different way. You will be able to apply these
principles to any language you prefer to use.

This material can be given in a workshop format, ideally over two days, covering
several lessons and one or two capstone examples. Please contact [Timoth√©e
Poisot](mailto:timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca) for more information.

There are a number of ways to contribute. Before you start, please have a look
at our [Code of Conduct][coc]. It boils down to *be nice and respectful* -- no
contribution, no matter how amazing it may be, justifies or excuses bad
behaviour. For the actual details on how to contribute, head over to the
[guidelines][guid].
