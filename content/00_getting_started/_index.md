These modules offer a very high-level overview of how to setup a project,
organize your work, and install *Julia*. They do not require any familiarity
with programming, and are mostly concerned about making sure that you can plan a
computing project ahead of time. Note that installation instructions are not
covered until late into the module (by design!).
