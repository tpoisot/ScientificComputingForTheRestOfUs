**One specific challenge, when writing code as a scientist, is that we care *a
lot* about getting the *right* answer; but of course, the *right* answer is not
always obvious. So we should be very careful with the code we write. A piece of
code that crashes is annoying; but a piece of code that runs, and give you the
wrong answer can compromise your science and your career. This guide will help
you adopt practices that make it less likely to introduce mistakes in your code,
and more likely to catch them. Hopefully, this will let all of us write code we
can trust more.**

Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points. You can use these lessons on your own, or as a group.
